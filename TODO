	Little stuff...
DONE	    Get rid of the MAKE_b_xxx_FRAME_ macros.
DONE	    Clean up and comment second half of proc.h.
DONE	    Change mem_init_op to allow NULL.
	    Add procedure prototypes of some sort.
	    Add macros to ref numbered args.
		(e.g. #define ARG1 (pair_car(F_SUBJ)))
DONE	    It should be illegal to bind two C functions to the same symbol.
DONE	    Fix the makefile so subdirectories are rebuilt.
DONE	    mem_fixvec should export non-virtual element accessors.
DONE	    Rename bind.{h,c} to env.{h,c}.
DONE	    Construct roots, init heap after main() is called.
DONE	    Define UNDEFINED_OBJECT and use it instead of NIL.

	nonrecursive eval
 DONE	    Define C procedure API.
 DONE	    threaded model?
 DONE	    documentation
 DONE	    Clean up proc.h somehow?
 DONE	    Implement full set of arg lists, see r6rs 11.4.2.
 DONE	    Implement REBIND_PROC.
 DONE	    Debug call/cc.
 DONE	    Add test cases from r6rs chapter 11.

DONE	full mem model
 DONE	    define obj ops.
 DONE	    rewrite base objects.
 DONE	    rewrite frames to use objects.
 DONE	    write mixvec.
 DONE	    rewrite binding as mixvec.
  no	    rewrite procedure as mixvec?
 DONE	    change mixvec's int type to intptr_t
 DONE	    rewrite frame as mixvec.
 DONE	    must remove value from frame - not thread safe.
 DONE	    drop mem_init_op and mem_free_op.
	    Implement vectors.
	    Implement bytevectors.
	    Implement other numeric types.

	GC
 DONE	    stop and copy algorithm
 DONE	    Clean up.
 DONE	    Create run-time parameter to run debug code.
	    alternate algorithms!

	full reader
	    Write test suite.
 DONE	    Rename yyread to a better name.
	    Protect against gc.
	    Recognize characters.
	    Recognize strings.
	    Recognize vectors.
	    Recognize bytevectors.
	    Verify "#!r6rs".
	    Accept "#!/usr/bin/env cat".
 DONE	    Recognize nested #| ... |# comments.
 DONE	    Improve char classes for identifiers.
 	    Recognize peculiar identifiers.
	    Recognize hex escapes in identifiers.
	    Recognize all numbers.	
	    Rewrite for readability.
	    

DONE	decentralize unit testing.

	libraries
	    ???

	macros
 DONE	    Implement scheme primitives for cheezy-read, eval, and print.
 DONE	    Reimplement the main loop in Scheme.
	    Have lambda rewrite proc body as described in r6rs 11.3.
		All it needs to do is verify that no definitions
		follow expressions.
		(How does lambda push another proc onto the stack?)
	    See r6rs-lib 12.3.

	make readline better.
